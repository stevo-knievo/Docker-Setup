A repopulated mysql container ?
================================

Yeah why not, i like my test faster :D

But how ?
---------

The mysql/mariadb container image contain an init script that will execute everything in `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/`

see `Initializing a fresh instance` @ https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql/

So let's run this initialization in a multi-stage build and copy the initialized DB in the new image :D

(see comments in dockerfile for details of the hack) 

Try it!
======

Clone this, then...

```
}> docker build --tag my-prepopulated-image .
...

}> docker run -d --rm --name my-container my-prepopulated-image
...

}> docker logs my-container

(there was is initialization here, therefore we win)
